Defn: The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets.\n\
The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe, as also\n\
the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black letter,\n\
etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed from\n\
the Greek Alpha, of the same form; and this was made from the first\n\
letter (Aleph, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a\n\
consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an\n\
element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent\n\
their vowel Alpha with the ä sound, the Phoenician alphabet having no\n\
vowel symbols. This letter, in English, is used for several different\n\
vowel sounds. See Guide to pronunciation, §§ 43-74. The regular long\n\
a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has taken\n\
the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was\n\
a sound of the quality of ä (as in far).\n\

Defn: A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various\n\
sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from an, a forms of\n\
AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot, abed, amiss, asleep,\n\
aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg), and analogically, ablaze, atremble,\n\
etc. (2) AS. of off, from, as in adown (AS. ofdüne off the dun or\n\
hill). (3) AS. a- (Goth. us-, ur-, Ger. er-), usually giving an\n\
intensive force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in\n\
arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English y- or i- (corrupted from the AS.\n\
inseparable particle ge-, cognate with OHG. ga-, gi-, Goth. ga-),\n\
which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in\n\
aware. (5) French à (L. ad to), as in abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab,\n\
abs, from, as in avert. (7) Greek insep. prefix a without, or\n\
privative, not, as in abyss, atheist; akin to E. un-.\n\

Syn.\n\
 -- To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign; abdicate;\n\
quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake; leave; retire; withdraw\n\
from.\n\
 -- To Abandon, Desert, Forsake. These words agree in representing a\n\
person as giving up or leaving some object, but differ as to the mode\n\
of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a\n\
thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one\s friends, places,\n\
opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked\n\
vessel. Abandon is more widely applicable than forsake or desert. The\n\
Latin original of desert appears to have been originally applied to\n\
the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the verb, when\n\
used of persons in the active voice, has usually or always a bad\n\
sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of\n\
something which the person should rightfully stand by and support;\n\
as, to desert one\s colors, to desert one\s post, to desert one\s\n\
principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not\n\
necessarily bad; as, the fields were deserted, a deserted village,\n\
deserted halls. Forsake implies the breaking off of previous habit,\n\
association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been\n\
familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to forsake the\n\
paths of rectitude, the blood forsook his cheeks. It may be used\n\
either in a good or in a bad sense.\n\

wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile.\n\
 -- Abandoned, Profligate, Reprobate. These adjectives agree in\n\
expressing the idea of great personal depravity. Profligate has\n\
reference to open and shameless immoralities, either in private life\n\
or political conduct; as, a profligate court, a profligate ministry.\n\
Abandoned is stronger, and has reference to the searing of conscience\n\
and hardening of heart produced by a man\s giving himself wholly up\n\
to iniquity; as, a man of abandoned character. Reprobate describes\n\
the condition of one who has become insensible to reproof, and who is\n\

_para_\n\
Syn.\n\
 -- To Abase, Debase, Degrade. These words agree in the idea of\n\
bringing down from a higher to a lower state. Abase has reference to\n\
a bringing down in condition or feelings; as to abase one\s self\n\
before God. Debase has reference to the bringing down of a thing in\n\
purity, or making it base. It is, therefore, always used in a bad\n\
sense, as, to debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the mind by\n\
vicious indulgence, to debase one\s style by coarse or vulgar\n\
expressions. Degrade has reference to a bringing down from some\n\
higher grade or from some standard. Thus, a priest is degraded from\n\
the clerical office. When used in a moral sense, it denotes a\n\
bringing down in character and just estimation; as, degraded by\n\
intemperance, a degrading employment, etc. \"Art is degraded when it\n\
is regarded only as a trade.\"\n\

In OE. somewhat confused with abase. Cf. Finish.]\n\
_para_\n\
Defn: To destroy the self-possession of; to confuse or confound, as\n\
by exciting suddenly a consciousness of guilt, mistake, or\n\
inferiority; to put to shame; to disconcert; to discomfit.\n\
Abashed, the devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is. Milton.\n\
He was a man whom no check could abash. Macaulay.\n\
_para_\n\
Syn.\n\
 -- To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.\n\
 -- To Abash, Confuse, Confound. Abash is a stronger word than\n\
confuse, but not so strong as confound. We are abashed when struck\n\
either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of inferiority; as,\n\
Peter was abashed in the presence of those who are greatly his\n\
superiors. We are confused when, from some unexpected or startling\n\
occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and self-possession. Thus, a\n\
witness is often confused by a severe cross-examination; a timid\n\
person is apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. We\n\
are confounded when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were, by\n\
something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have\n\
nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually confounded at the\n\
discovery of his guilt.\n\
Satan stood Awhile as mute, confounded what to say. Milton.\n\

battere (popular form for L. batuere to beat). Cf. Bate, Batter.]\n\

ABATE\n\
A*bate\", v.i. Etym: [See Abate, v.t.]\n\

before the heir takes possession. See Abatement, 4.\n\
_para_\n\
Syn.\n\
 -- To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish; lessen.\n\
 -- To Abate, Subside. These words, as here compared, imply a coming\n\
down from some previously raised or exited state. Abate expresses\n\
this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of\n\
intensity; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the force of the\n\
wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever abates. Subside (to settle\n\
down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion;\n\
as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm.\n\
When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be\n\
observed. If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of\n\
intensity or strength, the word to be used is abate. Thus we say, a\n\
man\s anger abates, the ardor of one\s love abates, \"Winter rage\n\
abates\". But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from\n\
preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is subside;\n\
as, the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided into\n\
a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous\n\
in their nature; as, his passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided,\n\
his grief subsided into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such cases,\n\
we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might\n\
use abate; as, his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in\n\
other instances.\n\

concealing, etc., is an accessory. An accomplice is one who\n\

Macaulay.\n\
_para_\n\
Syn.\n\
 -- Capacity; talent; cleverness; faculty; capability; efficiency;\n\
aptitude; aptness; address; dexterity; skill. Ability, Capacity.\n\
These words come into comparison when applied to the higher\n\
intellectual powers. Ability has reference to the active exercise of\n\
our faculties. It implies not only native vigor of mind, but that\n\
ease and promptitude of execution which arise from mental training.\n\
Thus, we speak of the ability with which a book is written, an\n\
argument maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It always\n\
something to be done, and the power of doing it. Capacity has\n\
reference to the receptive powers. In its higher exercises it\n\
supposes great quickness of apprehension and breadth of intellect,\n\
with an uncommon aptitude for acquiring and retaining knowledge.\n\
Hence it carries with it the idea of resources and undeveloped power.\n\
Thus we speak of the extraordinary capacity of such men as Lord\n\
Bacon, Blaise Pascal, and Edmund Burke. \"Capacity,\" says H. Taylor,\n\
\"is requisite to devise, and ability to execute, a great enterprise.\"\n\
The word abilities, in the plural, embraces both these qualities, and\n\
denotes high mental endowments.\n\
